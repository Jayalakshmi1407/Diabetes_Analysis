 🩺 Diabetes Risk Analysis Dashboard

This project is an interactive dashboard built using Streamlit and the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset.
It provides descriptive statistics, visualizations, and predictive modeling to understand the risk factors for Type 2 diabetes.

-> 📊 Features

 Upload and explore diabetes dataset (CSV)
 Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, range, std dev)
 Visualizations: histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, heatmaps
 Diabetes prevalence across age groups, BMI categories, and pregnancies
 Hypothesis testing & correlations
 Predictive modeling:

   Multiple Linear Regression (Glucose prediction)
   Logistic Regression (Diabetes outcome prediction)
 Interactive filters for custom analysis
